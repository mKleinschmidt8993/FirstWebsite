      Lately, the game I have been most interested in would be Hadrian's Wall.
      It is a game that look's very complicated upon first glance, but after
      further explomation can be broken down into a few parts:
    </p>
    <h2>Defense</h2>
    <p>
      The primarly part of the game is about defending the wall, it keeps you
      from losing points (disdain) and can earn you valor (which will convert to
      points at the end of the game)
    </p>
    <h2>Resource Production</h2>
    <p>
      Gaining resources is critical to being able to building the wall and
      completing anything with the merchant tracks. You begin with the 8
      resources on the starting card and then check your resource tracks for
      other resources you begin with (everyone begins with one stone).
